# Portfolio Website v1

Hi, I'm Kanishk Chinna and this website provides anyone with a glimpse of who I am.
This was my initial peak into web development and is an experience that has taught me a lot.
Using, what I've learned from this project and information I have picked up since its creation, I've developed an updated version which is hosted where this site once was.
To take a look at this specific website navigate to, https://kchinna.github.io/portfolio-site-v1/.

Learn a little bit about my goals in the "about me" section

Take a look at some of the projects I've worked on in the "projects" section

You can find my resume in the aptly named "resume" section

And lastly, you can reach out to me with the built in form under the "contact me" section
